# Sync-Task1

This was a Simple Alarm project using python, I created a GUI using Tkinter library and adjusted the ability of adding a list of alarms and deleting from them. In addition I made the time space to check the alarm 5000 milisecond so that when the user decide to quit he wouldn't be bothered by the constant alarm message box poping up. Note: This is a 24 hour system alarm so don't use am. and pm.
